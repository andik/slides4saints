eng [D]Are we weak and heavy [G]laden, [D]Cumbered with a load of [A]care?
eng [D]Precious Saviour still our [G]refuge; [A]Take it to the Lord in [D]prayer.
eng [A]Do thy friends despise for[D]sake thee? [G]Take it [D]to the Lord in [A]prayer!
eng [D]In His arms Heâ€™ll take and [G]shield thee; [A]Thou wilt find a solace [D]there.
