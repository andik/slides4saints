eng Here I [D]raise mine Ebe[A]nezer, Hither [G]by Thy great help I [D]come;
eng And I [D]hope by Thy good [A]pleasure, Safely [G]to arrive at [D]home.
eng Jesus [D]sought me when a [A]stranger, Wandering [G]from the fold of [D]God;
eng He to [D]rescue me from [A]danger, Inter[G]posed His precious [D]blood.
