eng Oh to [D]grace how great a [A]debtor, Daily [G]I'm constrained to [D]be;
eng Let Thy [D]goodness, like a [A]fetter, Bind my [G]wandering heart to [D]Thee.
eng Prone to [D]wander, Lord I [A]feel it, Prone to [G]leave the God I [D]love;
eng Here's my [D]heart, Oh take and [A]seal it, Seal it [G]for Thy courts a[D]bove.
