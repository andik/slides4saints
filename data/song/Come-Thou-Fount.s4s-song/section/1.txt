eng Come, Thou [D]Fount of every [A]blessing, Tune my [G]heart to sing Thy [D]grace;
eng Streams of [D]mercy, never [A]ceasing, Call for [G]songs of loudest [D]praise.
eng Teach me [D]some melodious [A]sonnet, Sung by [G]flaming tongues [D]above;
eng Praise the [D]mount, I'm fixed u[A]pon it, Mount of [G]Thy redeeming [D]love.
